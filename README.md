### 21H2

- System Apps now have uninstall options
- Includes stable Microsoft Edge
- Windows Hello Face
- Windows Meet Now

21H2 apps added to cleanup-windows script

### 2004

#### Microsoft Defender

- Detects Changes to HOSTS File
- Potentially Unwanted App (PUA) App Blocking Protection

HOSTS file changes are detected as this is a known vector for malware.

If you make changes yourself you can simply click Allow.

PUA protection has been known to remove some apps people find useful & it can be disabled if it causes problems.

```
Set-MpPreference -PUAProtection 0
```

PUA protection may be useful so it's really down to personal preference.

#### Cortana

- now renamed from `Microsoft.Windows.Cortana` to `Microsoft.Windows.Search`
- location of files now `Windows\SystemApps\Microsoft.Windows.Search_cw5n1h2txyewy`
- `rem-cortana.ps1` & `rem-sysapps.ps1` updated to fix this

### 1803 / 1809

Scripts still relevant, added new script to remove Microsoft Edge browser as it now seems to run in the background for some reason.

Microsoft also seem to have removed the GPO for disabling cortana in Software Policies.

Scripts feature ability to disable various Microsoft technologies / services which can be considered to spy or report on users of the Operating System. eg: Telemetry, Problem Steps Recorder, Application Impact Telemetry, Customer Experience Improvement Program, Geolocation, Biometric Information, Browser History ...

Cleanup folder features scripts to remove Microsoft OneDrive & move components relating to indexing of information within files (Cortana), reporting & information gathering.

## üêö Powershell

This folder has a few basic scripts, the most useful is **check-startup** which checks registry locations known to be used by malware & viruses to initiate on windows startup.

## üëç Tweaks

This folder has some old tweaks I made for Windows 7 which can still be used in Windows 8.1 / 10.

```
net_tweaks              sets TcpAckFrequency & TCPNoDelay to 1 on all network interfaces within the system
rem_spy_updates         removes Windows 7 & 8 updates which relate to install of telemetry
```

Most of the scripts here are documented on [my personal blog website](https://equk.co.uk/)
