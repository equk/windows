## :memo: Notes

#### 21H2

Many system apps in removal scripts now have uninstall options in add/remove programs.

Some can be found in the optional features section.

eg:

- Microsoft OneDrive
- Microsoft Cortana

others:

- Windows Hello Face
- Windows Media Player
- Windows Fax & Scan
- Microsoft Weather
- Microsoft Maps
- Skype

Microsoft Edge is also in the list but is required for other apps using Edge WebView.

Edge is now based on Google Blink browser engine & seems improved.

##### New Services

```ps
DmEnrollmentSvc    Device Management Enrollment Service
Fax                Fax
fdPHost            Function Discovery Provider Host
p2pimsvc           Peer Networking Identity Manager
p2psvc             Peer Networking Grouping
ssh-agent          OpenSSH Authentication Agent
vmickvpexchange    Hyper-V Data Exchange Service
```

##### Script Changes

`misc-tweaks` now disables Meet Now in the taskbar

#### 2004

- Windows Defender Detects Changes to HOSTS File
- Windows Defender Potentially Unwanted App (PUA) App Blocking Protection
- cortana renamed from `Microsoft.Windows.Cortana` to `Microsoft.Windows.Search`

HOSTS file changes are detected as this is a known vector for malware.

If you make changes yourself you can simply click Allow.

PUA protection has been known to remove some apps people find useful & it can be disabled if it causes problems.

```
Set-MpPreference -PUAProtection 0
```

PUA protection may be useful so it's really down to personal preference.

#### 1909

- 1909 features new app package `Microsoft.Windows.StartMenuExperienceHost`
- 1909 new service `autotimesvc        Cellular Time`

#### 1809

Microsoft Edge browser background process re-spawns the cortana searchui process if it gets killed.

*It is possible to remove cortana after removing msedge*

#### 1803

Added new script to remove Microsoft Edge browser as it now seems to run in the background.

*Microsoft seem to have removed the GPO for disabling cortana in Software Policies.*

#### :warning: Cleanup

#### Remove Unwanted Components

- cleanup/rem-cortana.ps1
- cleanup/rem-msedge.ps1
- cleanup/rem-onedrive.ps1
- cleanup/rem-people.ps1
- cleanup/rem-sysapps.ps1

(apps now have uninstall options with 21h2)

*Cleanup folder contains scripts which could cause problems with Windows Components as it removes unwanted applications / components.*

*Some updates will re-install Microsoft Edge Browser & Cortana (can be removed again running the scripts after update)*
